About this Project:
This project is an Animal-Crossing themed story-based game. You fly to an island in hopes for a new home, but Tom Nook is not happy about that. 
He puts you in thousands of dollars in debt, and you have to adventure around Paradise Island finding resources so you can pay him back and stay. 
You can collect fruit, shells, flowers, bugs, and fish! 
Try to get as much as you can before Tom runs out of patience!
